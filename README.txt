Assignment 1 - HTML webpage featuring Tabs.

This project is a web application that allows the user to add, edit, delete, reset, and output the content of 15 tabs. 
There are two boxes, one which contains the content for each tab which can be edited, and one that shows the user the HTML of the output webpage.
